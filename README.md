# CHATGPT








Nice — I’ll give you a tested, *copy-pasteable* step-by-step workflow (with comments) you can run from **Git Bash on your HP laptop** to:

1. create and connect to a Vast.ai instance,
2. upload your `.ply` to that instance,
3. install and run **GauStudio** on the instance, and
4. extract a mesh (`.obj`) from the Gaussian `point_cloud.ply`.

I read the GauStudio README (install + mesh-extract usage) and Vast.ai docs (SSH / data movement) while preparing this — I’ll cite the important bits inline so you know where each requirement comes from. ([GitHub][1])

---

# Quick plan (what you’ll do)

1. Generate SSH key on your laptop and add to Vast.ai. ([Vast.ai][2])
2. Launch an Ubuntu instance on Vast.ai with a **NVIDIA GPU ≥ 6 GB VRAM** (choose driver/CUDA enabled image). GauStudio requires NVIDIA+CUDA & Python≥3.8. ([GitHub][1])
3. `scp` (or `vastai copy` / cloud download) your `.ply` into the instance. For big files (>1GB) prefer cloud storage + `wget` or `vastai copy`. ([Vast.ai][3])
4. SSH in, install Miniconda, PyTorch (match CUDA reported by `nvidia-smi`), `pip install -r requirements.txt`, install rasterizer submodule, `python setup.py develop`. ([GitHub][1])
5. Put your `.ply` under the expected structure and run the mesh extractor command shown in the README: `gs-extract-mesh -m <input_output_dir> -o <out_dir>`. ([GitHub][1])

---

# Detailed commands (copy-pasteable)

> Replace placeholders (ALL CAPS) with your values: `YOUR_EMAIL`, `IPADDR`, `PORT`, `YOUR_LOCAL_PLY_PATH`, `SCENE_NAME`, etc.

---

## A — On your laptop (Git Bash): create SSH key and add to Vast.ai

```bash
# 1) generate an SSH key pair dedicated for Vast (ed25519 recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "YOUR_EMAIL" -f ~/.ssh/vast_ed25519
# when prompted, press Enter to accept defaults (or set passphrase)

# 2) print the public key so you can copy it into the Vast.ai "Keys" page
cat ~/.ssh/vast_ed25519.pub
# copy the full line starting with "ssh-ed25519 ..." to your clipboard

# Next: open https://cloud.vast.ai/manage-keys/  (Vast UI) and paste that public key as a new key.
# (This ensures new instances automatically get your key.) See Vast docs. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
```

---

## B — Launch a Vast.ai instance (UI)

1. On Vast.ai pick an **Ubuntu** server (20.04 or 22.04 recommended), choose a GPU flavor with **>=6GB VRAM** (README prerequisite). ([GitHub][1])
2. In the instance creation UI: pick the SSH key you added, and choose an *SSH/Direct* or regular SSH instance (you’ll get an IP + PORT in the instance card/“Connect” panel).
3. Save IP and PORT (you’ll use them below). If your `.ply` is very large, consider uploading it to Google Drive / S3 and using `wget` from the instance (faster for large transfers). ([Vast.ai][3])

---

## C — Upload your `.ply` into the instance (small files via `scp` from Git Bash)

**In Git Bash** your Windows paths look like `/c/Users/you/...` — use that.

```bash
# Example: copy local file to /root/data/SCENE_NAME/point_cloud/iteration_0000/point_cloud.ply on the instance
# Replace PORT, IPADDR, YOUR_LOCAL_PLY_PATH, SCENE_NAME
scp -P PORT /c/Users/Jacky/Desktop/my_splat.ply root@IPADDR:/root/data/SCENE_NAME/point_cloud/iteration_0000/point_cloud.ply

# Note: Vast's SSH proxy may be slow for >1GB transfers; for large files use:
#  - upload to cloud storage (gdrive/s3) and `wget`/`curl` on the instance, OR
#  - use `vastai copy` CLI which uses rsync-like fast transfers. See Vast data movement docs. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
```

---

## D — SSH into your instance (Git Bash)

```bash
# open an interactive SSH session (replace PORT and IPADDR)
ssh -p PORT root@IPADDR
# after connecting you will be in a tmux session on Vast by default
```

---

## E — (On the instance) install system packages and Miniconda

```bash
# update + small deps
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git wget build-essential cmake libgl1

# get Miniconda (non-interactive)
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O /tmp/miniconda.sh
bash /tmp/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"
# ensure conda commands are available in this shell
eval "$($HOME/miniconda/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
```

---

## F — Create conda env (python 3.8) and inspect GPU/CUDA

```bash
# create & activate env (GauStudio recommends python 3.8)
conda create -n gaustudio python=3.8 -y
conda activate gaustudio

# check GPU + CUDA driver to pick the right PyTorch wheel
nvidia-smi
# note the "CUDA Version" printed by nvidia-smi (e.g., "11.8" or "12.x"), you'll use this to pick the correct PyTorch install.
```

---

## G — Install PyTorch (match your CUDA) and Python deps

**From GauStudio README:** GauStudio has been tested with `torch==1.12.1+cu113` and `torch==2.0.1+cu118`. Pick a command that matches `nvidia-smi` output. ([GitHub][1])

Example installs:

```bash
# If nvidia-smi shows CUDA 11.3 or you want conda-managed cudatoolkit 11.3:
conda install pytorch=1.12.1 torchvision=0.13.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -y

# OR if your machine requires a cu118 wheel (pip):
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Now install the GauStudio Python requirements:

```bash
# from the instance; clone repo first
git clone https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/gaustudio.git
cd gaustudio

# install python deps listed in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
# (requirements include plyfile, torch, torchvision, tqdm, opencv-python-headless, vdbfusion, trimesh, omegaconf, einops, kiui, scipy). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

# if any package fails (e.g. vdbfusion) try pip install vdbfusion directly:
pip install vdbfusion || true
```

---

## H — Install the custom rasterizer & develop the package

```bash
# build/install the custom rasterizer submodule first
cd submodules/gaustudio-diff-gaussian-rasterization
python setup.py install   # may compile C/C++ code; watch for errors

# go back and install gaustudio in develop mode (so CLI scripts are registered)
cd ../../
python setup.py develop
# after this you should have the 'gs-extract-mesh' script available in PATH (or at least the module).
```

(If `python setup.py develop` succeeds it will register package scripts; GauStudio README uses the same steps.) ([GitHub][1])

---

## I — Prepare input folder structure (GauStudio expects `cameras.json` + `point_cloud/iteration_xxxx/point_cloud.ply`)

GauStudio expects the *output_dir* produced by a GS pipeline to have this minimal structure:

```
output_dir/
  cameras.json        <-- necessary (poses)
  point_cloud/
    iteration_0000/
      point_cloud.ply  <-- your file
```

If you uploaded your PLY to `/root/data/SCENE_NAME/point_cloud/iteration_0000/point_cloud.ply`, create a `cameras.json` (if your GS pipeline produced one, copy it). If you do not have `cameras.json`, GauStudio may fail or produce poor texturing — best is to use the original pipeline’s camera file or produce poses with COLMAP / nerfstudio. ([GitHub][1])

Example commands to create the minimal folders and move your uploaded file into place:

```bash
# create expected dirs and move the uploaded file (adjust paths if different)
mkdir -p /root/data/SCENE_NAME/result/point_cloud/iteration_0000
# if you used the earlier scp example path, move there:
mv /root/data/SCENE_NAME/point_cloud/iteration_0000/point_cloud.ply /root/data/SCENE_NAME/result/point_cloud/iteration_0000/point_cloud.ply

# verify
ls -l /root/data/SCENE_NAME/result/point_cloud/iteration_0000/
# confirm point_cloud.ply is present
```

**Important**: `cameras.json` is listed as *necessary* by the GauStudio README — if your .ply came from another tool, locate the associated cameras/poses file and copy it into `/root/data/SCENE_NAME/result/cameras.json`. ([GitHub][1])

---

## J — Run the mesh extractor

Try the CLI recommended in the README first:

```bash
# run GauStudio mesh extractor (replace SCENE_NAME and output folder)
gs-extract-mesh -m /root/data/SCENE_NAME/result -o /root/output/SCENE_NAME_output

# if gs-extract-mesh is not on PATH after develop install, try running the script directly:
python gaustudio/scripts/extract_mesh.py -m /root/data/SCENE_NAME/result -o /root/output/SCENE_NAME_output

# or as a module (if needed)
python -m gaustudio.scripts.extract_mesh -m /root/data/SCENE_NAME/result -o /root/output/SCENE_NAME_output
```

If the command runs it will create mesh files in `/root/output/SCENE_NAME_output` (a fused mesh PLY / supporting files). The README shows this exact CLI usage. ([GitHub][1])

---

## K — Convert the resulting `.ply` to `.obj` (if you want an `.obj`)

GauStudio outputs a fused mesh (PLY). Use `trimesh` (already in requirements) to convert:

```bash
# example: convert fused_mesh.ply -> fused_mesh.obj
python - <<'PY'
import trimesh, sys, os
in_ply = "/root/output/SCENE_NAME_output/fused_mesh.ply"    # <- adjust filename if different
out_obj = "/root/output/SCENE_NAME_output/fused_mesh.obj"
mesh = trimesh.load(in_ply, process=False)
mesh.export(out_obj)
print("Wrote", out_obj)
PY
```

(If `trimesh` isn't present, `pip install trimesh` — but it should be in requirements.) ([GitHub][4])

---

## L — Copy the `.obj` back to your laptop

From your laptop (Git Bash):

```bash
# copy the obj back to your laptop desktop
scp -P PORT root@IPADDR:/root/output/SCENE_NAME_output/fused_mesh.obj /c/Users/Jacky/Desktop/
```

If the file is large, again prefer cloud storage / `vastai copy` to transfer efficiently. ([Vast.ai][3])

---

# Troubleshooting & tips (short)

* If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails: upgrade pip `pip install -U pip` and re-run. Some packages like `vdbfusion` are pip-installable directly (`pip install vdbfusion`). ([PyPI][5])
* If `gs-extract-mesh` throws errors about missing `cameras.json`, you must supply camera poses (COLMAP / nerfstudio export) — GauStudio expects `cameras.json`. ([GitHub][1])
* If you see `No CUDA` / `RuntimeError: CUDA not available`, re-check `nvidia-smi` and ensure your PyTorch install matches CUDA version. ([GitHub][1])
* For very large `.ply` files, avoid scp via the SSH proxy — upload the file to cloud (S3/gdrive) and `wget` or use `vastai copy`. ([Vast.ai][3])

---

# Short checklist before you run

* [ ] Have you added your SSH public key to Vast.ai (account Keys)? ([Vast.ai][2])
* [ ] Did you choose a GPU instance with ≥ 6GB VRAM (Ubuntu)? ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Is your `.ply` uploaded into `/root/data/SCENE_NAME/result/point_cloud/iteration_0000/point_cloud.ply`?
* [ ] Do you have the matching `cameras.json` in `/root/data/SCENE_NAME/result/`? (required for good results). ([GitHub][1])

---

If you want, I can:

* produce a single **startup script** (bash) that you paste into Vast.ai "startup script" field to automate everything (install conda, clone, install deps), or
* tailor the exact `scp` and ssh commands if you paste the *IP:PORT* and your local path right here.

Which would you prefer? (If you want the automated startup script, I’ll generate it now — no waiting required.)
